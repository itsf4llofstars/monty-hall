## From the poplular TV game-show "Lets Make a Deal" this is the Monty Hall problem simulator.

The Monty Hall problem is a probability excersise where contestant is shown three closed doors.<br>
Behind two of the doors are losses, behind one of the doors is a win. The contestant picks one<br>
door in hopes that this door is a winner. The host then reveals the contents of one of the other<br>
two doors, this is always a losing door. The contestant then has the option to stick with their<br>
first choice or choose the other door. Is it better for the contestant to remain on the first choice?<br>
Is is it better for the contestant to switch doors?<br>

Lets have Python find out what gives the better win probability, switch or no-switch.<br>
